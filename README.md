In this project, we will be exploring the following dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhmores/spotify-top-100-songs-of-20152019

Please refer to the following notebooks in order: (1) EDA_final.ipynb, (2) Lin_Reg_final.ipynb, and (3) PCA_Classification_final.ipynb. Each notebook contains code, descriptions, and visualizations of the processes described in our report.

(1) EDA

Explored and visualized various trends with line and bar
graphs, histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices. Our analysis was
tailored to the following questions:

1. Are there significant correlations between characteristics of a top song?
What are the highly correlated predictors of popularity scores?

2. Do certain song genres, top artists, and artist types have higher or lower
popularity scores?

3. Do certain years in which songs were a hit contain different distributions
in song characteristics than other years?

4. Are there significant correlations between characteristics of a top song?
What are the highly correlated predictors of popularity scores?

(2) Popularity Prediction

Methods used: Linear Regression, LASSO, K-Fold


(3) Genre Classification

Methods used: PCA, Logistic Regression, XGBoost
